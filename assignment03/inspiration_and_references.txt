Sailing and boating in general is pretty cool. The free feeling of being out at sea,
and the exhileration of moving swiftly through the water is something I am trying to 
capture. Additionally, infinite runners are uniquely fun in their comforting simplicity.
There's no complicating factors in the game - everything is as it was and as you expect 
it to be, forever. Kind of like the expanse of the ocean.
