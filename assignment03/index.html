      <p>In designing this game, I had to first bring together an idea of what I was looking for, think for some inspiration for a game to create. Sailing and boating in general is pretty cool, I thought. The free feeling of being out at sea,
      and the exhileration of moving swiftly through the water. Additionally, infinite 
      runners are uniquely fun in their comforting simplicity. There's no complicating factors 
      in the game - everything is as it was and as you expect it to be, forever. Kind of like the expanse of the ocean...
      I pulled together assets and inspiration from across the internet, and began to work. This game was developed using the p5 javascript library which provides an environment for quick prototyping of 
      frame by frame graphics rendering. I developed the structure for the code, opting for an object-oriented design to keep track of the behavior of all the game objects. Additionally, I utilized 
      a stateful design model to keep track of game diferent modes. This all together allowed me to easily manipulate objects and variables throughout the game.
      Overall, this development process made me realize how much stateful and object oriented design can help organize and simplify the development process for these dynamic programming situations.
